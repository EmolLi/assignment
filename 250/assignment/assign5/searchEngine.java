	   and assign their results to a LinkedList of Strings.
	   2) To iterate over all elements of a LinkedList, use an Iterator,
	   as described in the text of the assignment
	   3) Refer to the description of the LinkedList methods at
	   http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/ .
	   You will most likely need to use the methods contains(String s), 
	   addLast(String s), iterator()
	   4) Refer to the description of the HashMap methods at
	   http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/ .
	   You will most likely need to use the methods containsKey(String s), 
	   get(String s), put(String s, LinkedList l).
